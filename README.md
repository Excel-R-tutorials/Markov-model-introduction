## Abstract
A health economic evaluation (HEE) is a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences. A cost-effectiveness analysis is a type of HEE that compares one intervention to one or more alternatives by estimating how much it costs to gain an additional unit of health outcome. Cost-effectiveness analyses are commonly performed using Microsoft (MS) Excel. However, there is current interest in expanding the available toolkit to using other software that is better suited to more complex problems, methods, and data, as well as improved reproducibility and transparency. In this tutorial we provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement a mainstay model of HEE, namely a Markov model, in the statistical programming language R. We describe the technical details from the perspective of a MS Excel user to help bridge the gap between software and reduce the learning curve by providing for the first time side-by-side comparisons of the Markov model example in MS Excel and R.
